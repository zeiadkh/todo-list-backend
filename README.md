## Project Overview

This project is built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. The application is connected to a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage and management.

### Purpose

This is my first time using NestJS and PostgreSQL, and the goal of this project is to explore and showcase my learning process while implementing CRUD operations, service layers, database integration, and other backend logic.

## Technologies Used
- **NestJS** - Framework for building server-side applications.
- **PostgreSQL** - Open-source relational database for managing data.
- **TypeScript** - For writing clean and scalable code.
- **TypeORM** - Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interaction.
- **Postman** - API testing and interaction.

## Features
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- RESTful API endpoints.
- PostgreSQL database integration using TypeORM.
- Well-structured and modular NestJS application.
- Configuration management using `.env` files.
- Include validation and exception handling for enhanced robustness.
- user authentication (JWT).
